## Remove boarder
Use OpenCV for removing boarders

## Image preprocessing
Image Processing techniques using OpenCV and Python: https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing
### Pre processing - shades
Use "Shading correction based on Gaussian smoothing" - create a "background" using a large mean filter and subtract/divide by this to remove shades

## Segmentation
### Use template matching for identification
Use template matching (OpenCV) to find typical lichen or typical errors. Could give good results for removing b√§garlav
