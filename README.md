# ReindeerLichens
Project in Scientific Computing (1TD316)

## Ideas 

### Remove boarder
Use OpenCV for removing boarders

### Pre processing - shades
Use "Shading correction based on Gaussian smoothing" - create a "background" using a large mean filter and subtract/divide by this to remove shades

### Use template matching for identification
Use template matching (OpenCV) to find typical lichen or typical errors. Could give good results for removing b√§garlav
