## Image preprocessing
Image Processing techniques using OpenCV and Python: https://github.com/BhanuPrakashNani/Image_Processing
### Remove boarder
Use OpenCV for removing boarders
### Pre processing - shades
Use "Shading correction based on Gaussian smoothing" - create a "background" using a large mean filter and subtract/divide by this to remove shades

## Generate masks/labling

### GrabCut
https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d83/tutorial_py_grabcut.html (used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00787.pdf)

### Labelme
https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme

### Lightly
https://www.lightly.ai/: Self-supervised learning. Built to help you understand and work with large unlabeled datasets.

## Segmentation
### Use template matching for identification
Use template matching (OpenCV) to find typical lichen or typical errors. Could give good results for removing bÃ¤garlav
