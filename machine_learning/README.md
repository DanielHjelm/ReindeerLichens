# Machine learning

This directory contains all the code used for the machine learning part of the project.

- [ML_Lichens.ipynb](https://github.com/DanielHjelm/ReindeerLichens/blob/main/machine_learning/ML_Lichens.ipynb) contains the code for training and saving the machine learning model.
- [predict.py](https://github.com/DanielHjelm/ReindeerLichens/blob/main/machine_learning/predict.py) uses the saved model to predict on new new images
- [evaluate.py](https://github.com/DanielHjelm/ReindeerLichens/blob/main/machine_learning/evaluate.py) evalautes the performance of the network
- [prediction_server.py](https://github.com/DanielHjelm/ReindeerLichens/blob/main/machine_learning/prediction_server.py) is the prediction server used during the data labeling process.
